## Source

All sources are available in the `./resource` directory. You can edit and the resources. The files get checked once a
day by the different modules in the app.

### Regular Expressions

Regex expressions are saved in the `./resource/expressions.json` file in JSON format.

Each regex looks like this:

    {
    "name": "ipv4",
    "expression": "^((?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)).*",
    "type": "ipv4"
    },

_**Name**:_  The UNIQUE name of the regular expression. 

_**Expression**:_ The regex 

_**Type:**_ The type of expression. For IPs, it is
usually is a ipv4 or ipv6. For IP proxy, its http, https, sock4, sock5.

### Emails and IPs

The IP files are stored in the `./resource` directory and start with `ip_` such as `ip_tor` for tor.
Each file takes in an array of sources:

    {
      "name": "stopforumspam",
      "url": "https://www.stopforumspam.com/downloads/toxic_domains_whole.txt",
      "timeout": 10,
      "feed": [
        {
          "score": 3,
          "expression": "domain"
        }
      ]
    }  

- Name: The name of the source
- URL: the URL of the source, this can be a text file, ipset or something similar
- Timeout: Time before the link should timeout.
- Feed: An array of feeds
  - Score: The score between 0â€“5 (with 5 being the highest priority).
  - Expression: This part references the regex expression name below.

For each source, you can have multiple feeds with multiple expressions. 
For example, if a source has both Ipv4 and Ipv6 in it, you can reference different regular expressions.
